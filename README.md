# The Optimal Experimental Design Toolbox

## Introduction

This is the readme of the `Optimal Experimental Design Toolbox`. The `Optimal Experimental
Design Toolbox` allows to optimize model parameters and corresponding
measurement conditions.


## Download

You can download the current version of the `Optimal Experimental Design Toolbox`
at <https://github.com/jor-/edt>


## Installation

If you want to use the `Optimal Experimental Design Toolbox`, please add the
folder of the `Optimal Experimental Design Toolbox` to your `Matlab` path or
change inside `Matlab` your current folder to this folder. Afterwards you
can use the `Optimal Experimental Design Toolbox`. Further you can view the
`Optimal Experimental Design Toolbox` documentation via the following `Matlab`
command.

`doc optimal_experimental_design_toolbox`
